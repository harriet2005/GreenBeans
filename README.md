TEAM NAME: CAMPUS INNOVATORS

PROJEST TITLE: GREEN BEANS_ protecting our planet is not our job its our legacy_ 
GreenBeans is a web-based platform designed to help schools in Kenya organise, track, and showcase environmental activities. Inspired by the principles of Wangari Maathai, the platform focuses on community engagement, youth empowerment, and simple digital tools that make environmental clubs more active and impactful.

What we do: provide students with a simple online platform where they can easily join or connect with existing environmental clubs and communities, participate in verified climate-action activities, and collaborate with partner organisations through weekly or monthly challenges 

Built with React.js for the frontend and Supabase for the backend, GreenBeans gives students and teachers a clean, easy-to-use digital space to manage green clubs, share achievements, participate in challenges, and track real environmental impact.

  **Problem We Are Solving**
 There is no united platform that connects Kenyan student-based environmental clubs and community organisations, leading to fragmented efforts, low engagement, and                    little visibility for youth climate action also Many Kenyan schools face challenges managing environmental clubs efficiently:

  * Activities are unorganised and hard to track.
  * Teachers manage everything manually, leading to heavy administrative burdens.
  * Students have no platform to publicly share achievements and successes.
  * No centralised system for organising large events like tree planting or clean-ups.
  * Good environmental efforts exist — but there is no cohesive structure to sustain them.

The result: low participation, limited visibility, and weak long-term impact.

 **Our Solution**
 provide students with a simple online platform where they can easily join or connect with existing environmental clubs and communities, participate in verified climate-action                 activities, and collaborate with partner organisations through weekly or monthly challenges 

 The platform enables:

  * Club Management – Easy creation, organisation, and management of green clubs.
  * Activity Tracking – Log tree planting, clean-ups, workshops, and other events with detailed records.
  * Media Feed – Students and clubs can share photos/videos of their activities, fostering a sense of community.
  * Challenges & Competitions – Teachers and partners can post challenges to boost participation and friendly rivalry.
  * Teacher Dashboard – A centralised view to track progress, involvement, and generate reports.
  * Student Profiles – Allows learners to build a personal environmental portfolio, showcasing their commitment and leadership skills.

GreenBeans makes environmental action organized, visible, and rewarding.
