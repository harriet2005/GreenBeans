TEAM NAME: CAMPUS INNOVATORS
PROJEST TITLE: GREEN BEANS 
Problem statement: There is no united platform that connects Kenyan student-based environmental clubs and community organizations, leading to fragmented efforts, low engagement, and                    little visibility for youth climate action
What we do: provide students with a simple online platform where they can easily join or connect with existing environmental clubs and communities, participate in verified climate-action                 activities, and collaborate with partner organizations through weekly or monthly challenges
